# JavaScript Projects

### Contains my self-improvement projects.

---

1. #### Login Form with Signup
   - Some functionality are not completed. Focused on Css and some javascirpt. When you click Sign up content will be changed.
   - You can hide password when you click eye icon.
2. #### To Do List
   - A simple application that allows users to manage their tasks (edit, delete mark as completed) with localstorage.
3. #### Chrome Extension (Lead Tracker)
   - I employed query method along with the Chrome Tab API to interact with the browser tab system.
   - Additionally, I implemented the capability to store data in the Local Storage, for saving previous inputs in case of any loss.
   - For icons, I used fontawesome.com to download the external resource into my package folder and load the script locally. Since Chrome extensions don't allow external scripts due to Content Security Policy.
4. #### Color Flipper
   - Every time the button is clicked, the background color will change.
5. #### Student Card Discount
   - This is a simple library checkout process where customers can add books to their cart and make payments either with or without a library card, with appropriate discounts applied.
   - I worked on using ES6 features(class,constructor, inheritance) in this project.
6. #### Find Images
   - Fetch the pictures from unsplash.com.
   - The function calls the Unsplash API using the fetch method with the user's name as a query. It includes an authorization header with an API key to authenticate the request.
   - I used fontawesome.com to access icons.
7. #### Exchange Rate
   - I used freecurrencyapi.com to manage the most recent exchange rate conversions.
